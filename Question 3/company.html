      <h2><u>Question One</u></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Initial Consultation:</h3> <p>Schedule a meeting with the company to understand their requirements, <br>goals, and target audience. Discuss their brand identity, desired features, and any specific design preferences.<br> Gather all necessary information about the company and its products or services.</p></li>

        <li><h3>Define Scope and Objectives:</h3><p> Based on the initial consultation, clearly define the scope of the project. <br>Outline the website's functionality, key pages, and any additional features or integrations required. <br>Set specific objectives and determine the project's timeline and budget.</p></li>
        
       <li><h3>Planning and Wireframing:</h3> <p>Create a sitemap that outlines the website's structure and navigation. <br>Develop wireframes or sketches to visualize the layout and placement of key elements on each page.<br> This step helps in establishing a clear website hierarchy and user flow.</p></li> 
        
       <li><h3>Design and Mockups:</h3><p>Create a visual design for the website using graphic design tools or website builders.<br> Consider the company's branding guidelines, color scheme, typography, and overall aesthetics. <br>Design key pages such as the homepage, product/service pages, contact page, etc., and create mockups for client approval.</p></li> 
        
        <li><h3>Content Creation:</h3><p>Work with the company to gather content for the website, including text, images, <br>videos, and other media. Ensure that the content aligns with the company's branding and effectively communicates their message. <br>Optimize the content for search engines (SEO) if required.</p></li> 
        
       <li><h3>Development:</h3><p>Once the design and content are approved, begin the development phase. Depending on the <br>complexity of the website, you can choose to code it from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or <br>utilize a CMS like WordPress or Drupal. Develop and integrate the required functionalities, such as contact forms, <br>e-commerce capabilities, or third-party integrations.</p></li> 
        
        <li><h3>Testing and Quality Assurance:</h3><p>Thoroughly test the website's functionality, responsiveness, <br>and compatibility across different devices, browsers, and screen sizes. Check for any bugs, broken links, or performance issues.<br> Conduct user testing to gather feedback and make necessary improvements.</p></li> 
        
       <li><h3>Deployment and Launch:</h3><p>Prepare the website for deployment by configuring domain settings, <br>setting up hosting, and transferring files to the live server. Perform a final check to ensure all elements are <br>in place and the website is ready for launch. Make the website publicly accessible and monitor its performance.</p></li> 
        
        <li><h3>Post-Launch Support and Maintenance: </h3><p>Offer post-launch support to the company, addressing any <br>issues or concerns that arise. Provide training if needed, so they can manage and update the website themselves. <br>Regularly update the website's software, plugins, and security measures to maintain its functionality and security.</p></li>
